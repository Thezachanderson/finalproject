The puzzles are a potential feature that will involve 2d sprites in a pop up window that the player will solve to activate other in room features.
These features could include the creation of enemies, treasure chests, doors being opened, etc.

Puzzle ideas include:

Gearbox:
    Gear sprites to be rotated to match a certain alignment

Simon says:
    Buttons will light in order, starting with one, that player must match the order. This will continue with an increased nunmber in the pattern
    that stops after an amount that is scaled to the difficulty of that level.

Maze:
    player is given a grid with walls and must find a solution to the maze. This may be too difficult to implement.
